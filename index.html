			Hi! Welcome to my website! My name is Jordan Baron and I am a student at Northeastern University Studying journalism and interaction design. Located here are all the projects I have taken a part in thus far in my collegiate career. Please take some time to look through!
		</p1>
		<p1>
			The midterm icon will bring you to my midterm project for my 5D fundamentals class. The project is currently in the process of being created, and updates will be posted as the development of the project continues.
		</p1>
		<p1>
			The box model icon will bring you to one of the first small projects I created. Josef Albers was a German-American artist who was known for his box model art. My task was to recreate his art into a modern website model.
		</p1>
		<p1>
			The tertiary colors icon will bring you to my first major coding project. My task was to create a small app to help remind people what tertiary colors are.
		</p1>
		<p1>
			The new yorker remake icon is a project in which I recreated a page of the New Yorker website.
